# Assignment: Create a Counter Component with State Management

## Objective
A simple React application that demonstrates the understanding of state management, asynchronous state updates, and the concept of state as a snapshot.

### Buttons
The "Increment" button should increase the count by 1.
The "Increment After Delay" button should increase the count by 1 after a 2-second delay.
The "Increment Twice" button attempts to increment the count by 2 immediately. This is to demonstrate batching and how React treats multiple state updates.
The "Correct Increment Twice" button should correctly increments the count by 2 using a state updater function

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
